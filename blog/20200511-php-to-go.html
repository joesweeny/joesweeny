                <p>
                    Up until November 2018 my commercial development experience consisted of predominantly PHP with a splatter of Vue JS thrown in.
                    I'd spent my early development career honing my skills using PHP but the time came to broaden my horizons and as advised by
                    a colleague I took on the challenge of learning another programming language.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I felt comfortable with server side development so should I focus my attention on learning front end or should I learn another
                    server side language? I was advised by someone who I held in high regard to learn another server side language. Doing so would not
                    only add another string to my bow it would improve me as a software developer and improve the way I write PHP.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With this advice on board I decided to learn Go. Having read numerous Medium articles and popular development forums Go was
                    gaining a lot of traction and popularity so naturally felt the right direction to Go (no pun intended).
                </p>

                <p>
                    I dug into blog posts, YouTube videos and various other literature but I found the barrier to entry quite steep coming from my
                    PHP background. I often found myself looking for PHP to Go comparison resources to help reduce this barrier so I've put this post
                    together for anyone who finds themselves in the same position I was in.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Go community and ecosystem is extremely good at providing documentation, examples and tutorials especially to get you off the ground.
                    The aim of this post is to dive into common programming concepts and provide a clear comparison to help PHP developers making the leap
                    into Go development that little bit smoother.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Dynamic vs Static Typing</h2>
                <p>
                    PHP is a dynamic programming language although since PHP 7.0 I've seen it described as a <i>gradually</i> typed language.
                    Meaning on the whole PHP is a dynamic language with some static type features. Users of PHP have the flexibility to adhere
                    to strict conventions such as function argument type hinting and declaration of return types however on the flip side users
                    can opt not to conform to any strict typing convention and still have a fully functional application.
                </p>

                <p>
                    PHP allows developers to dynamically declare variables of a certain type and then override the same variable with a different
                    type.
                </p>

                <script src="https://gist.github.com/joesweeny/f2c343d589c3054faa15979fbc423be6.js"></script>

                <p>
                    Even with strict typing set PHP still allows variables to be assigned with a new type inside a function. The below providing an example
                    of a type hinted function with a return type declaration and a clear defined docblock:
                </p>

                <script src="https://gist.github.com/joesweeny/bc1c5ed64aa450da78f3b5276fb4bfae.js"></script>

                <p>
                    Go on the other hand is a statically typed language with strict typing enforced. Variables are assigned a type at the time of
                    declaration and once assigned cannot be converted or cast to another type. Attempting to do so will result in a compiler error.
                </p>

                <script src="https://gist.github.com/joesweeny/de7a5495b6dcfdb66b4cdbd873462635.js"></script>

                <p>
                    Return types are also strict and function arguments MUST HAVE a type declaration. The PHP example above allowed a null or string
                    return type whereas Go is strict in the sense that the return type can ONLY be one defined type. Go's approach to the above PHP code above is
                    defined as:
                </p>

                <script src="https://gist.github.com/joesweeny/071540975209ef346f8f7da7058e0272.js"></script>

                <p>
                    Go's strict typing convention provides the over riding feeling of <i>what you see is what you get</i>. It reduces the need for additional
                    type checking inside functions and provides an additional level of robustness and confidence sometimes lost in weaker typed systems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My personal approach to PHP has always been to adopt a strict approach using explicit types. I often utilise static
                    analysis libraries such as <a href="https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan" target="_blank">PHPStan</a> to enforce this approach on my projects
                    so for Go to enforce strict typing out of the box was not a complete culture shock to me.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On the other hand if you feel more comfortable using PHP to it's more flexible capabilities the adoption of a stricter approach is
                    something you will need to come to terms with. The inclusion of typed properties in PHP 7.4 brings PHP a step closer to the conventions
                    Go promotes so should PHP developers choose to utilise this convention in their projects the barrier to entry from PHP to Go could
                    somewhat be reduced.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Class vs Struct</h2>

                <p>
                    Classes in PHP are blueprints of objects that contain properties in the form of internally scoped variables with class behaviour defined in methods.
                    The Go alternative is called a struct (short for structure). A struct is a user defined type that contains a collection of data fields with declared
                    data types. Comparative examples in PHP and Go are below:
                </p>

                <script src="https://gist.github.com/joesweeny/0d6f6b7e28024ce67536728c84849866.js"></script>

                <script src="https://gist.github.com/joesweeny/3d43bf0a4f60bcab811916ada810b39e.js"></script>

                <p>
                    PHP enforces classes to be instantiated with their required properties whereas struct types is Go can be instantiated in
                    a variety of ways.
                </p>

                <script src="https://gist.github.com/joesweeny/68b9b05a570323fbc9dff443c90b5eb1.js"></script>

                <p>
                    Methods can be added to struct types using a method receiver.
                </p>

                <script src="https://gist.github.com/joesweeny/c2ed32b677c86c300c70d12a41a8ed68.js"></script>

                <p>In Go terminology the above example reads as <i>the <strong>FullName</strong> method has a receiver type of <strong>Person</strong>.</i></p>
